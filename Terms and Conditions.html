    <h5>Terms and Conditions</h5>
<br>

<strong>Online Test Only</strong>
<br>
The assessment is strictly conducted in online mode only, ensuring accessibility and convenience for participants across different locations. There will be no provision for offline or in-person testing. All registered users will receive their test link, login credentials, and important instructions via their registered email prior to the examination date.

Participants are required to ensure they have access to a compatible device—such as a laptop, desktop, or smartphone—along with a stable internet connection during the test. The online format is designed to offer flexibility, transparency, and a modern assessment experience aligned with current digital standards.

All candidates must adhere strictly to the test guidelines to maintain fairness and integrity throughout the process. Any form of misconduct or policy violation may lead to disqualification or permanent restriction from future participation.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Certificate Provided</strong>
<br>
Upon successful completion of the online test, each participant will be awarded a digitally verifiable certificate as official recognition of their performance. The certificate will be issued by an organization registered under the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME), Government of India, which adds credibility and value to the document.

This certificate can serve as a proof of participation or skill enhancement, and may be used to showcase competence in relevant areas for academic, professional, or personal development purposes. The certificate will be delivered electronically to the participant’s registered email ID, typically within a few days after test evaluation.

Please note that the certificate is non-transferable and will carry the participant’s name, test name, date of completion, and a unique verification ID (if applicable). Misuse, duplication, or falsification of the certificate is strictly prohibited and may invite legal consequences.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>MSME Certified</strong>
<br>
The certification issued upon completion of the test is backed by an organization registered under the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME), Government of India. This official registration ensures that the issuing body complies with national standards for professional development and capacity building.

Being MSME-certified not only adds legitimacy and trust to the certificate but also enhances its value for candidates seeking recognition in educational, competitive, or employment sectors. The MSME registration number may be included on the certificate or provided upon request for verification purposes.

This affiliation ensures that the entire process—from the test to the issuance of the certificate—is managed by an authorized and credible organization, reinforcing the certificate’s authenticity and national relevance.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>No Refund Policy</strong>
<br>
All payments made for the online test are non-refundable under any circumstances. Once the registration fee is successfully paid, it will not be refunded, reversed, or transferred, regardless of the reason—including, but not limited to, non-attendance, technical issues from the user’s side, or dissatisfaction with the process or outcome.

Participants are advised to read all the test details carefully before proceeding with the payment. By completing the payment, users agree to this policy and acknowledge that they understand the terms of service. This policy helps maintain the integrity and administrative efficiency of our platform while ensuring equal treatment for all candidates.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>One User, One Access</strong>
<br>
Each registration is strictly limited to a single individual and is non-transferable. The login credentials (including test links, certificates, and other related information) are provided solely for the registered user and must not be shared, distributed, or used by anyone else.

Sharing access with others, attempting multiple logins from different devices simultaneously, or misusing login details in any form will be treated as a violation of our terms and may result in cancellation of access or certificate without refund. This policy ensures fair participation and maintains the credibility of the testing process.

<br>
<br>
<br>


<strong>Access via Email</strong>
<br>
All important communication, including the online test link, user credentials, test instructions, and certificate (after completion), will be sent directly to the email address provided during registration. It is the responsibility of the participant to ensure that a valid and regularly monitored email ID is entered at the time of form submission.

The organization will not be responsible for any issues arising from incorrect or inaccessible email addresses. Please check your inbox (and spam/junk folder) regularly to avoid missing any critical updates related to the test.


<br>
<br>
<br>


<strong>Limited Time Offer</strong>
<br>
The discounted pricing for the online test is part of a promotional offer available for a limited period only. Participants are encouraged to complete their registration within the specified timeframe to avail the benefit of reduced fees.

Once the offer period expires, the pricing will revert to the standard registration amount, and no exceptions or extensions will be entertained. This limited-time discount is non-negotiable and subject to change or withdrawal at the discretion of the organization without prior notice.


<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Misuse Prohibited</strong>
<br>
All test materials, content, and credentials provided are strictly for individual and authorized use only. Any form of sharing, duplication, resale, or public distribution of the test, answers, or certificate is a direct violation of our terms and conditions.

Such misuse will result in immediate disqualification, cancellation of the certificate, and may lead to legal consequences. We reserve the right to take appropriate legal or administrative action against users found engaging in unauthorized or unethical activities. Your cooperation in maintaining the integrity of the test process is expected and appreciated.


<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Certificate Validity</strong>
<br>
The certificate issued upon successful completion of the online test serves as proof of participation and skill assessment. It is valid for inclusion in personal profiles, resumes, and portfolios to reflect individual effort and knowledge.

Please note that this certificate does not guarantee employment, promotions, or academic credit, and its recognition depends on the discretion of the receiving organization or institution. While the certificate is backed by an MSME-registered organization, it is intended solely for informational and self-development purposes.


<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>No Job Guarantee</strong>
<br>
The completion of the online test and issuance of the certificate does not imply or ensure any job offer, employment, internship, or placement opportunity from the organization or any of its affiliates.

This program is designed to assess and certify individual knowledge or skills for personal development only. Users are advised not to interpret the certificate as a promise of career advancement, job placement, or professional endorsement.


<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Publicly Viewable Certificate</strong>
<br>
The certificate issued upon successful completion of the test may be stored and made accessible through a public URL for verification purposes. This means anyone with the link may be able to view the certificate details, including the participant’s name, score, and date of issue.

By participating in the test, you consent to the public availability of your certificate data for authentication or reference by third parties such as employers, institutions, or other interested entities. No additional personal data will be shared beyond what is shown on the certificate.


<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Test Date May Vary</strong>
<br>
Please note that the scheduled test date is subject to change based on organizational requirements, technical considerations, or unforeseen circumstances. While we strive to maintain the announced schedule, we reserve the right to reschedule, postpone, or adjust the test date with or without prior notice.

Participants are advised to regularly check their registered email or the official communication channel for updates regarding the test schedule. No claims will be entertained in case of rescheduling, and participation in the updated schedule will be considered as acceptance of the change.


<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Device Responsibility</strong>
<br>
Participants are solely responsible for arranging a suitable device with stable internet connectivity to appear for the online test. The organization does not provide any hardware, software, or technical assistance related to device setup.

It is the user's responsibility to ensure that their device (laptop, desktop, or smartphone) is fully functional, compatible with the testing platform, and free from technical issues. Any loss of access, disconnection, or failure due to device malfunction will not be considered valid grounds for reattempt or refund.


<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Fake Information Will Lead to Disqualification</strong>
<br>
Providing false, misleading, or incomplete information during registration or while appearing for the test will result in immediate disqualification without any refund. The organization reserves the right to verify participant details at any stage of the process.

Submitting incorrect personal data, impersonation, or using fake credentials violates the terms of participation and will lead to permanent debarment from current and future programs.


<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Violation Consequences</strong>
<br>
Any violation of the test rules, terms of use, or misuse of content—including but not limited to unauthorized sharing, multiple logins, impersonation, or tampering with the system—will result in strict action. This may include immediate disqualification, revocation of issued certificates, denial of future participation, and permanent account suspension. The organization also reserves the right to take legal action in case of severe breaches.


<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Certificate Is Not Government Job Proof</strong>
<br>
The certificate issued upon successful completion of the test is intended solely for recognition of participation or demonstration of skills. It is not a government-issued document and does not serve as proof for eligibility in any government job or recruitment process. Participants are advised not to misrepresent or use the certificate for any official employment claims, particularly in government sectors.


<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>No External Help</strong>
<br>
Participants must complete the test independently without any assistance from external sources, including individuals, books, or the internet. The integrity of the assessment depends on honest individual effort. Any attempt to use unauthorized help during the test will be considered a violation of our terms and may result in disqualification, cancellation of the certificate, or a permanent ban from future tests.


<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Certificate Format</strong>
<br>
All certificates will be issued in a secure digital format (PDF) only. No physical or printed copies will be provided. Participants can download and store the certificate for future reference. This format ensures easy accessibility, quick sharing, and eco-friendly distribution while maintaining the authenticity of the document.


<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Promotional Use</strong>
<br>
By participating in the test, users grant the organizers the right to use non-sensitive information such as names, scores, or achievements for promotional purposes. This may include showcasing top performers on websites, social media, or marketing materials to inspire and encourage others. No personal data such as contact details will be shared without consent.


<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Technical Glitch Policy</strong>
<br>
In case of any technical issues during the test—such as website downtime, login failure, or sudden disconnection—participants are advised to immediately report the problem via the official support email. While every effort will be made to resolve genuine issues, the organizers are not responsible for problems arising due to the participant’s device, internet connection, or software. Re-attempts may be allowed solely at the discretion of the organizing team.


<br>
<br>
